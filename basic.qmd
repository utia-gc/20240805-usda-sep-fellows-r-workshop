# Basic Analysis

## Introduction

This page introduces a brief, basic analysis of grass weights using R.

The workflow for a basic analysis consists of two main steps:

1. Preparing the data --- Raw data is read into R and processed into data that is in a format that we can analyze.
2. Analyzing the data --- Data is visualized to create plots and tables, and a formal statistical analysis is performed.

We can visualize the steps of this workflow with a graph:

```{mermaid}
flowchart TB
    data_file[("Data file")]
    read_data[Read data\ninto R]
    wrangle_data["Clean/format\ndata"]
    cleaned_data>"Analysis-ready\ndata"]

    subgraph "Prepare data"
        data_file --- read_data --- wrangle_data --> cleaned_data
    end

    viz_data["Visualize data"]
    visualizations>"Plots &\ntables"]
    stat_ansys["Statistical analysis"]
    ansys_res>"Analysis results"]
    
    subgraph "Analyze data"
        cleaned_data --- viz_data --> visualizations
        cleaned_data --- stat_ansys --> ansys_res
    end
```
